# AutoStereota

Gradient index (GRIN) lenses can be used to image deep brain regions
otherwise inaccessible via standard optical imaging methods. Brain tissue aspiration
before GRIN lens implantation is a widely adopted approach. However, typical brain
tissue aspiration methods still rely on a handheld vacuum needle, which is subjective to
human error and low reproducibility. Therefore, a high-precision automated surgical
instrument for brain tissue aspiration is desirable.
We developed a robotic surgical instrument that utilizes robotic control of
a needle connected to a vacuum pump to aspirate brain tissue. The system was based
on a commercial stereotaxic instrument, and the additional parts can be purchased offthe-
shelf or Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machined. A MATLAB-based userfriendly
graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to control the instrument.
Our robotic surgical instrument is an ideal solution for brain tissue
aspiration prior to GRIN lens implantation. It will be useful for neuroscientists performing
in vivo deep brain imaging using miniature microscope or two-photon microscope
combined with microendoscopes.
